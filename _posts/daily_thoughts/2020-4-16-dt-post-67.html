<p>You know, sometimes, just sometimes, there's this moment where you are SO proud of yourself for not revealing any of your private life to her, do you know what I mean? Especially when her stubbornness starts to catch fire, especially when she's caught up in some another conspiracy theory, especially when she's just blurting out inconsiderate, condescending comments toward my friends EVEN THOUGH THAT'S NOT THE TRUTH IN ANY POSSIBLE WAY (and especially when that's being justified into some ultimate truth under the oh-only-the-grown-ups-can-understand-that-and-you-kids-are-just-dumb doctrine). Whenever I see a sign where she starts to drag the conversation to such direction, I just literally shut down myself, shut down my communication with her at least for that moment.</p>
<p>At any rate I believe we are not particularly fond with someone who's too judging, right? But you know, sometimes you have this feeling that 'Hmm, maybe that's not the worst possible scenario, huh?', you know what I mean?</p>
<p>To put it in simple words, it's merely just top of the glacier that's being magnified into some gi-GAN-tic ice mountain or sth, during what we often refer to as "mom-talks". What just straight-up pisses me off is that the other person who's listening to that s**ty piece of rumor gets to think as if that what really is just a mere top of the glacier actually is the whole thing, without ever realizing she's in fact ignoring the 98% of the whole f**king glaicer. And if we go through about two or three "mom-talks", what originally was a little two-meter tall glacier all of a sudden starts to pierce through the stratosphere like crazy.</p>
<p>And one more thing: I don't know if one has any legitimacy in making judgements about another person as to how he seems to feel these days, especially when she knows NOTHING about what's underneath the sea surface.</p>
<br>
<p>But again, sometimes I just think that this way of communication is not simply the best relationship you can have with anyone, let alone your own parents. I know that sometimes you should be more open to your parents, and be willing to have active conversations with them, be more engaged with them. But you know, these excruciating moments that I have to suffer thru, just sometimes make me think that I'm doing the right thing to keep a safe distance from my parents, just sometimes endorse my own conviction in terms of keeping my own secrets.</p>
