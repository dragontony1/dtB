<p>The other day, while I was reading Friedrich Schlegel's 'Lucinde', I came across this artistically written part that pretty much thoroughly represents my thoughts these days regarding the nature of men & women. Although I know I'm not supposed to be reading romanticist texts literally, still I think we deserve the luxury to lay down our consciousness from time to time and let ourselves be engulfed by the rupture, the ecstasy these wonderful words and sentences present us.</p>
<blockquote>She was of an easy, cheerful disposition and her conversation seemed charming to him. But what he took for divine frivolity on her part was nothing more than thoughtless enthusiasm without any real joy or cheerfulness, or even spirit, except for just enough intelligence and wit to mix everything up intentionally and pointlessly, attract and manipulate men, and intoxicate herself with flattery. Unfortunately, he received some signs of her favor, of a sort that don't commit the giver because she can't admit she has given them, but which bind the ensnared novice even more inextricably because of the magic with which this secrecy endows them. A furtive glance or a squeeze of the hand was enough to bewitch him, or a word spoken in front of everyone but understood only by himself in its real context â€” all he needed was to have this cheap and simple gift made piquant by the illusion of some unique and special significance. She gave him, or so he thought, an even more unmistakable sign, and he was deeply offended that she should show so little understanding by anticipating him in this way. He was rather proud that this did offend him, and yet he was irresistibly aroused when he thought he had only to be quick about it and seize the favorable opportunity in order to arrive unhindered at his goal. He was already reproaching himself bitterly about his delay when he suddenly began to suspect that her forwardness was merely a deception and that she wasn't being honest with him. And when a friend explained the whole affair to him, he could doubt it no longer. He realized that people found him ridiculous, and he had to admit to himself that they were quite right in doing so. Realizing this enraged him and he might very well have done something regrettable if he hadn't already observed very closely and therefore absolutely despised these empty people, their petty affairs and quarrels, the whole spectacle of their secret motives and concerns. </blockquote>
<p>...and here comes the climax!</p>
<blockquote>(...) and the only thing that became increasingly clearer and more certain to him was the fact that great and perfect folly and stupidity were intrinsic prerogatives of men, and wanton malice, combined with naive coldness and laughing insensitivity, the congenital art of women. That was all he learned from his painful attempt to gain an understanding of human nature. In any given particular case he would always ingeniously fail to grasp the truth of the matter because he would forever presuppose subtle motives and deep plots, and because he had no feeling whatsoever for insignificance.</blockquote>
<p>Shit... Chills, man!</p>
