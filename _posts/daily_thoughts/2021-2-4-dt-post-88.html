<p>요즘 레딧<del>과 아스팔트ㅋㅋㅋ쌉잘한다</del>에 빠져있다. 더 자극적인 웃음, 순간적인 즐거움을 주는 걸 찾다가 밈의 세계에 빠져버렸다.</p>
<p>여러 서브레딧에 구독 중인데, r/depression에 나와 비슷한 사람들이 많이 보인다. 공감가는 글들도 많고, 무엇보다 쓰는 언어도 다르고 자라온 환경도 다르지만 하는 생각들은 정말 똑같다는 게 소름이 돋았다.</p>
<p>다음은 r/depression에서 읽었던 많이 공감가는 글들이다. 그냥 여기에 한번 남겨두고 싶어서 가져와봤다.</p>

  "You don't need a relationship to be happy" Bullshit you don't, that's the only way anyone is happy. People in relationships that are healthy have it fucking made. Waking up next to someone. Having physical touch. I miss physical touch. I'll never have that again. I think my therapist is ready to just give up on me because she's getting frustrated. I don't blame her. Now is about the time everyone walks away and say "I don't know this is too much for me" and "Only you can make you happy". Funny I can't make a girl fall in love with me. Last I checked my track record it seems that I'm an unlovable fuck. So whatever. Fuck waking up alone for the rest of my life, I don't wanna live like that. Rope poisoning it is.

  I want a girlfriend just so that i can improve myself for her.<br>
  I want to be a better student, and i want to learn how to not hate myself, and be good enough for someone. Actually, no, i wanna be better. I just want to stop being fucking horny all the time. I wanna stop jerking off, stop playing video games most of the day, stop dozing off when im studying. I wanna improve myself for someone.<br>
  I need someone to fight for.<br>
  Fighting for myself seems like the biggest waste of time i can think of.<br>
  I just want somebody to want me around, man.

  I can relate to this on a personal level. Having a good girlfriend will make you a much better person in all aspects of life.<br>
  Unfortunately, most of the times, you need to improve yourself first and then you will find it easier to meet someone that loves you.<br>
  I also perfectly understand the “it’s a waste to fight for myself”. I actually have to agree on this. But you are not fighting for yourself, you need to fight for the boyfriend of your future girlfriend. (This means you in the future). Think about a girl that will love you in the future: you want to be the best person for her, so start now: work hard, be healthy, be confident, learn new things, workout, etc... so that when you meet that girl, you will make her very happy.<br>
  Hopefully that made some sense to you.<br>
  You can also see it as an investment. Invest in yourself first and then you will reap the rewards later on.<br>
  Now trust me, this is a lot easier said than done, but it’s a effort that will be worth the reward.
